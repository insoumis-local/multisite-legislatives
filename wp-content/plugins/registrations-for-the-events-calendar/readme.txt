== Description ==

The Registrations for The Events Calendar plugin is an extension for Modern Tribe's The Events Calendar (free edition).

Create a custom contact form that is revealed on a click on the single event post in a location of your choosing.

The form is submitted without leaving the page using AJAX.

Notification emails are sent to email addresses of your choosing as well as the form submitter. Details of the submission are saved in a custom table in the WordPress database.

Just about everything in the form is customizable including the text, required fields, registration limits, and the email messages.

Add as many text input fields as needed for your form.

Export individual event registrations with the .csv export button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I limit the number of registrations for an event? =

Yes. You can set up the maximum number of registrants on the "Form" tab.

= Can I add more fields to the form? =

Yes. There is a button to add custom text input fields on the "Form" tab.

= How do I disable registrations for a specific event? =

By default, registrations are enabled for every event. You can disable registrations for a specific event by checking the appropriate box on the "Edit Event" page or on the "Registrations" tab "Overview" page. You can also disable registrations by default by checking the checkbox on the "Form" tab.

= Can I set a deadline for when registrations are accepted? =

You can configure an offset for how long registrations will be available relative to the event start time.

= Can I edit registrations and export them for an event? =

Yes. Click on the button "Detailed View" for the event in which you'd like to edit or export registrations for.

= Can I display the registration form on another page or post? =

Yes. You would need to use the post ID for that event in the shortcode. Example: [rtec-registration-form event=743]

= The form is not hidden initially. Why is that? =

It's likely that you have a javascript error somewhere on that page. Try disabling other plugins or switching themes to see if this corrects the issue.

= What do I do if I have a request or need help? =

Go to the "Support" tab on the plugin's settings page and follow the link to our support page, setup instructions page, or feature request page.
